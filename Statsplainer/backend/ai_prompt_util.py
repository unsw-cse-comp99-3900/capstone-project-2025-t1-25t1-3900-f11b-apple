                When a study says Drug A reduced stroke risk by 30% (RR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55–0.89, p = 0.004), here’s what that really means. The relative risk is 30% lower, but what matters more is the absolute risk: if 7% of people on placebo had strokes, and only 4.9% on the drug did, that’s a 2.1% absolute reduction. In real terms, that means 210 strokes prevented per 10,000 people. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is 48, so 48 people need to take the drug for 5 years to prevent one stroke. That’s a meaningful, if modest, benefit.

                The confidence interval (0.55 to 0.89) tells us the true effect probably lies between an 11% and 45% risk reduction, and since it’s entirely below 1.0, it’s statistically consistent with a real effect. The p-value of 0.004 means there’s only a 0.4% chance these results happened by luck if the drug did nothing. So when we say the effect is “probably real,” we mean the evidence strongly suggests the drug works,not guaranteed, but highly likely, especially for people at higher risk.

                Alright here’s how it works: your body has little messengers called melatonin that help you get sleepy. We gave some kids a gentle helper, like a tiny vitamin, and then we checked their spit to see how many messengers were working. About an hour and a half later, there were lots more of them! Even when we shined a bright light, those messengers kept doing their job. So, the helper made bedtime signals stronger and light didn’t really stop them. Cool, right?

                Let’s say a study finds that Drug A reduces the risk of stroke by 30% (RR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55–0.89, p = 0.004). Think of it like this: if your chance of stroke is like drawing a losing card from a deck of 100, and normally 7 people draw that card, Drug A lowers that number to about 5. That’s a small shift a 2.1% absolute difference but across a crowd, it adds up. Out of every 48 people who take the drug for 5 years, one stroke is prevented. That’s like needing 48 umbrellas in a storm to keep one person completely dry and not perfect, but still protection.

                The confidence interval is like weather forecasts saying the rain will drop by 11–45%. We’re not sure of the exact number, but we’re confident it’s going down. And the p-value of 0.004? That’s like saying there’s only a 0.4% chance the clear skies happened by coincidence and the umbrella likely worked.

                So when we say the effect is “probably real,” we mean this isn’t a fluke. It’s like seeing fewer puddles after everyone’s been handed umbrellas its not magic, but meaningful.
